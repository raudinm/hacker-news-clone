## 🔧 Usage

### Browsing Stories

- Visit the homepage to see the top stories
- Click on any story title to view details and comments
- Use the header navigation (currently links to home for demo)

### Viewing Comments

- Comments are displayed with proper nesting
- Click on story links to navigate to external sites
- Time stamps show relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")

### Submitting Stories

- Navigate to `/submit` to access the submission form
- Fill in title, URL, or text content
- Submit button logs the data (demo - doesn't actually post to HN)

## 🌐 API Integration

The app uses the official Hacker News Firebase API:

- **Top Stories**: `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json`
- **Story Details**: `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json`
- **Comments**: Fetched recursively using the same item endpoint

## ⚡ Data Fetching with SWR

This project uses SWR (stale-while-revalidate) integrated with Clean Architecture for efficient data fetching and caching:

### Clean Architecture Integration:

SWR is wrapped in custom hooks within the Application Layer, maintaining separation of concerns:

```typescript
// Application layer hook integrating SWR with Clean Architecture
export const useTopStories = (limit: number = 30) => {
  const { data, error, isLoading, mutate } = useSWR<StoryViewModel[]>(
    ["top-stories", limit],
    () => fetchTopStories(limit), // Uses Clean Architecture use case
    {
      revalidateOnFocus: false,
      revalidateOnReconnect: true,
      refreshInterval: 300000,
    }
  );

  return { stories: data || [], isLoading, error, mutate };
};
```

### Key Benefits:

- **Automatic Caching**: API responses are cached to reduce redundant requests
- **Background Revalidation**: Data updates automatically in the background
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic and error recovery
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators for better UX
- **Request Deduplication**: Identical requests are automatically deduplicated
- **Focus Revalidation**: Data refreshes when user returns to the tab
- **Architecture Compliant**: Maintains Clean Architecture boundaries

### Configuration:

- **Stories**: Refresh every 5 minutes with focus/reconnect revalidation
- **Comments**: Cached with background updates for nested replies
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry on failed requests
- **Clean Separation**: SWR logic isolated from business logic

## 🎨 Styling

- **Header**: Orange background (#ff6600) with white text
- **Typography**: Arial font family for authenticity
- **Layout**: Max-width container with responsive padding
- **Links**: Standard blue links with hover effects
- **Comments**: Indented threads with gray borders

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Other Platforms

The app can be deployed to any platform supporting Next.js:

- Netlify
- Railway
- Heroku
- AWS Amplify
